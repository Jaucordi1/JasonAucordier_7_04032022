Only one file is concerned about the different implementations, depending on which branch you checkout, check the file `/js/utils/array.js`.

`master` branch contains the most-performant implementation and can be viewed live [here](https://jaucordi1.github.io/JasonAucordier_7_04032022/).\
`native-loops-implementation` branch contains the less-performant implementation, with native loops.
